    </h2></em>
	<ul>
      <li>Obedience<br>
      We offer 3 different levels of obedience traing; Intro to Obedience, Basic Obedience, and Advanced Obedience. The Intro course is designed for puppies and new owner to learn and begin working and build that needed relationship with the dog. Basic covers all basic commands like sit, stay, down, and begins to introduce more advance techniques like place and heel. Our advance course offers an owner the chance to really test the dogs full potentional! After completion of this course your dog will be able to hold a place, heel off leash around a busy enviroment, and much much more!</li>
      <li>Service Dog<br>
        We offer a longer course after advanced obedience that registers your dog as a service dog. The timeline will vary depending on the dogs performance but its estimated completion time is 16-32 weeks. Other stipulations to this you must provide us with a Physicians note stating clinically why and what services your dog needs to be trained for. (Also not all dog breeds are eligable for this training due to state and government restrictions.)
      <li>Tactical<br>
        We work with the local police, sheriff, and other law enforcement agencies to help them achieve whatever mission the need. Whether you need a drug and bomb sniffing K9, a multipurpose K9, or a bite dog we can assist in reaching those goals. We also offer home defense K9 training for the civilian sector for those who want the best gaurd dog around!</li>
